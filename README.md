## Course material

### Literature

The seminar uses two books, both of which are available in print form at a modest cost. You should before the seminar starts get at least one of the two course books, either in electronic form or in print.

  * Al Sweigart: _Automate the Boring Stuff with Python_ [https://www.nostarch.com/automatestuff](https://www.nostarch.com/automatestuff)
    * Can be accessed for free online, see [http://automatetheboringstuff.com](http://automatetheboringstuff.com).
  * Eric Matthes: _Python Crash Course. A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming_. [https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse)

<!-- We expect that you at least have a look at the literature before the lecture.
The following table maps the lectures to book contents.
Please prepare for a lecture by reading the literature in at least one of the
books.

### Lecture notes and screencasts
Lecture notes and materials will be published after each session here: 
[https://github.com/itu-qsp/2019-fall-materials](https://github.com/itu-qsp/2019-fall-materials)

Video screencasts of the lectures will be available after each session here:

<!-- ### Supplementary material

We will try to add helpful tools, websites, and videos.
Codecademy uses Python2 but the main difference you will notice is that `print` works differently. Skip the "Pro" part. And Codecademy is not in the same order as the QSP sessions so take that into account.  
[SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com/) is a lovely learning tool. It's less verbose than Codecademy but it has an app! So you can practise while on public transport etc. [Apple iOS app here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1210079064) and [Android app here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sololearn).  
[Socratica playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCxv820i6xmK5BRmjt26bMUnWaxsAE27C) 2 hour total running time playlist that covers strings, numbers, doc strings, booleans, conditionals, functions, sets, lists, dictionaries, tuples, logging, the random module, classes and objects, sorting, text files, unit tests, and exceptions. It mostly uses the command line but in a very simple way. It is a bit ridiculous and I hope you'll love it. 

## Assignments
Please note that the assignments are **not** mandatory.
However, working on them will drastically improve your programming skills and your chances of passing 
the test. 
The TAs will provide you with feedback on your hand ins, so exploit the opportunity to understand what you did well and what you need to work on.

Assignments are detailed in each session (see the course material link above), under the `homework/` 
folder.
Hand-in should be done on LearnIT.

| Hand in deadline | Topic |
| ---------- | -----------------|
| 12/9 23:59 | 1: Understanding code |
| 19/9 23:59 | 2: Working with text |
| 26/9 23:59 | 3: Functions and lists |
| 3/10 23:59 | 4: Programs and modules |
| 10/10 23:59 | 5: Files and objects |
| 21/10 23:59 | 6: Testing and data analysis |
| 28/10 23:59 | 7: Searching and sorting |
| 4/11 23:59 | 8: Stacks and queues |
| 8/11 23:59 | 9: Icecream simulation |
| N/A | 10: ELIZA web server (no feedback) | -->

## Test
You **will need to pass the test in order to fully enroll**. But fear not: 
the goal is to get each and everyone one of you through this course.

The test will take place on the 2nd of August 2019 with a second test on the 16th of August.
Further information TBA.

## Learning outcomes
Please read this section carefully.
It is the expected outcomes for the course that you will be tested on:

    The student is able to
     - Analyse a given, simple computation task such as manipulation of a
       text-based database or external hardware device to the extent of
       designing a programmatic solution and implementing it in a modern,
       text-based, domain-neutral programming language
     - Test the correctness of a piece of code
     - Write program documentation
     - Reason about the computation complexity of an algorithm
     - Express functionality in terms of abstract data type or application
       programming interface
     - Use text-based tools of program development, including an editor,
       command-line tools, and a version control system
