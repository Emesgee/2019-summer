## Welcome to the QSP 2019!

This "session 0" is meant as an introduction to the course and its structure. 

## A note on the seminar

The seminar uses a lot of quite diverse materials: books, videos, articles and screencasts.
It is **purposefully** designed to be too much for you to consume during the course.
Instead, you should cherry-pick the modality/type of material that helps you the most. 

It is also vital that you are aware of the fact that you cannot learn everything at once.
And that when you learn something, you will forget parts of it. 
Humans learn by repetition, so you'll have to continuously read, apply, and reflect over the same items before you feel competent.
Embrace this uncertainty and realise you won't become a master programmer from day one.

This course is meant to take up 37 hours of your time every week.
We realise that is a lot of time.
But if you invest that time, we promise that you will be pass the test *and* become much smarter!

Finally, make sure you have *fun*!
While you are here to pass a seminar, you might as well make the most out of it.
Coincidentally, [staying motivated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation) helps a great deal when learning a skill...

### Literature

The seminar uses two books, both of which are available in print form at a modest cost. You should before the seminar starts get at least one of the two seminar books, either in electronic form or in print.

  * Al Sweigart: _Automate the Boring Stuff with Python_ [https://www.nostarch.com/automatestuff](https://www.nostarch.com/automatestuff)
  * Eric Matthes: _Python Crash Course. A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming_. [https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse)

The main book _"Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"_ can be accessed for free online, see [http://automatetheboringstuff.com](http://automatetheboringstuff.com).

For three of the later chapters we will use the book _"Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python"_, which is freely available online at [http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html).
